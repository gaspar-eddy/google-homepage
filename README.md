<!--- In making this webpage, I feel that I have reached an extremely basic and limited understanding of using html and CSS. After struggling for a days, I figured out how to use flexbos in order to organize items on my page and maintain an organized webpage as I resize it as well. Additionally, I was able to embed an image and create a searchbar. I struggled most with the header and the footer, as I still don't quite understand how these boxes fit within i=each other and how that will affect them as they move around. However, I am excited to keep learning more. -->
